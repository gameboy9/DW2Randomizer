# Dragon Warrior 2 Randomizer
## Features
- Adjust enemy attributes to DW2 Remix values. **
- Reduce gold and experience requirements to reduce grinding.
- Rename the prince and princess to whatever you want.
- Randomize XP/GP gains.
- Randomize equipment powers, as well as who can equip those items.
- Randomize monster stats and zones.
- Randomize spell learning and spell powers.  (i.e. Firebal could hit all enemies for 80 damage each)
- Randomize hero statistics
- Randomize stores and treasures (but certain items are guaranteed to be found before they are required)
- Four Levels Of Randomization (with an option to not randomize at all)
- An opportunity to adjust the seed from 1 to 2^32 (2 billion plus) for racing possibilities.
- Super speedy battles!
- Prologue automatically skipped.  The game now starts, albeit a bit awkwardly, with the soldier limping into Midenhall's Throne Room.
- All party members are revived with full HP and, with all three characters, MP on a party wipe(AKA ColdAsACod), regardless of save location. (this normally takes effect at the Rhone Shrine)

** If this is done, Army Ant's XP/GP will increase to 6XP/7GP so they are more in line with other enemies in its' class.  Also, Metal Babbles and Metal Slime's attributes will change so they have a very high chance of running, in line with other Dragon Warrior games.

## To Do/Wishlist
- Figure out a way to adjust the interface so magic can be randomized effectively without UI confusion. (this will be a 2.0 feature)
