# Dragon Warrior 2 Randomizer
## Features
- An opportunity to adjust some enemy attributes to DW2 Remix values.
- An opportunity to half the gold and experience requirements to reduce grinding.
- An opportunity to adjust the seed from 1 to 2^32 (2 billion plus) for racing possibilities.
- Four Levels Of Randomization

### For the first three levels (Slight, Moderate, Heavy)
- Monster zones are adjusted by one, three, or six "levels" in either direction.
- Boss fights are adjusted similarly.  There is an opportunity for other enemies to join in boss fights that normally wouldn't join.
- Treasures scrambled inside a zone in moderate difficulty, scrambled all over the world in heavy difficulty.  (but key items will stay in places before they are required)
- Weapon and item stores are scrambled similarly.

### Insane difficulty
- Monster zones are completely random, but they will be easier until the Moonbrooke shrine.
- Weapon and item stores are completely randomized.  You could buy Water Flying Clothes right away... or the Magic Loom or Dew's Yarn.  Or maybe the Thunder Sword or even a Leaf Of The World Tree!
- All monsters are completely randomized, except for their HP, Strength, XP, and their gold.
- Weapon and armor power are completely randomized from 1 to 100 for weapons, 70 for armor, 40 for shields, and 30 for helmets.
- Weapon and armor prices are adjusted according to the power randomized.  (power ^ 2.3, 2.4, 2.8, 3.0 for weapons, armor, shields, and helmets respectively)
- The only exceptions are the bamboo stick and clothes (maximum power 10 for each), because all members will start with those items.

## Notes
- This document is not yet finished; I'm sure I'm missing a bunch of stuff.
